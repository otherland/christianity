After his resurrection, **Jesus appeared to his disciples and others on multiple occasions**.  Bible records twelve specific appearances of Jesus post-resurrection. These appearances were significant in strengthening the faith of his followers and affirming his victory over death. Some of the key appearances include Jesus appearing to Mary Magdalene at the tomb, meeting with two disciples on the road to Emmaus, and appearing to the disciples in a locked room.

One of the most well-known appearances is when **Jesus appeared to Thomas**, who famously doubted his resurrection until he saw Jesus himself. Additionally, Jesus appeared to the disciples while they were fishing, showing them that he was truly alive. Each appearance served a specific purpose in reinforcing the reality of Jesus' resurrection and commissioning his followers to spread the good news. 

**Bible Verse: [John 20:19-20](https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-19.html)**
*"On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, 'Peace be with you.' When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord."*

- The appearances of Jesus post-resurrection also helped to fulfill prophecies from the Old Testament, such as the prophecy in [Psalm 16:10](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalm/16/Psalm-16-10.html) that Jesus would not see decay.
 
- Jesus' appearances to different people in various locations emphasized the universality of his resurrection and the message of salvation, reaching beyond just his immediate disciples.

- The post-resurrection appearances of Jesus were not just physical manifestations, but also moments of teaching and instruction for his followers, preparing them for their mission to spread the gospel to the ends of the earth.


## How many times did Peter see Jesus after the resurrection?

**Peter had multiple encounters with Jesus after his resurrection**. One notable appearance was when Jesus appeared to Peter specifically to restore him after Peter had denied knowing Jesus three times before the crucifixion.  interaction was significant in reaffirming Peter's role in spreading the gospel and serving as a leader in the early church.

Another important moment was when **Jesus appeared to a group of disciples, including Peter, by the Sea of Galilee**. During this encounter, Jesus reinstated Peter by asking him three times if he loved him, corresponding to Peter's earlier denials. These interactions with Peter demonstrated Jesus' forgiveness, grace, and restoration, showing that even those who have failed can be redeemed and used for God's purposes.

**Bible Verse: [John 21:15-17](https://www.bibleref.com/John/21/John-21-15.html)**
*"When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 'Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?' He said to him, 'Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.' He said to him, 'Feed my lambs.'"*

- Peter's encounters with Jesus after the resurrection not only served to restore Peter personally, but also to commission him for ministry.  highlights the transformative power of encountering the risen Christ in one's life.
 
- The repeated questioning of Peter's love for Jesus in the encounters by the Sea of Galilee was not only a form of restoration but also a way for Jesus to emphasize the importance of love as the foundation of discipleship and leadership.
 
- Peter's interactions with Jesus after the resurrection demonstrate the depth of Jesus' love and commitment to his disciples, showing that even in their failures and shortcomings, they are still chosen and valued for God's work in the world.


## How many saw Jesus ascend?

After his resurrection, **Jesus appeared to many individuals and groups before ascending to heaven**. The moment of Jesus' ascension is recorded in the book of Acts, where Jesus was taken up into heaven in the presence of his disciples.  Bible specifies that there were at least eleven disciples present to witness this miraculous event.

The ascension of Jesus was a pivotal moment in the Christian faith, as it marked the **completion of his earthly ministry** and the beginning of the disciples' mission to spread the gospel to the ends of the earth.  disciples who witnessed Jesus' ascension were filled with awe and wonder, knowing that Jesus had returned to the Father as he had promised.

**Bible Verse: [Acts 1:9-11](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/1/Acts-1-9.html)**
*"And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.  while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes, and said, 'Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.'"*

Each appearance served a specific purpose in strengthening the faith of his disciples and commissioning them to continue his work on earth.  we reflect on these appearances, may we be reminded of the hope and assurance we have in the resurrection power of Jesus Christ.
