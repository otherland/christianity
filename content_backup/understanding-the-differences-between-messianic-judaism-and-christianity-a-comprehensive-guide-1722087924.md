- **Observing** **biblical** **feasts** like **Passover** and **Feast** of **Tabernacles** provides **Messianic** **Jews** with **opportunities** to **reflect** on **God's** **redemptive** **work** in **history** and **anticipate** **fulfillment** of **messianic** **prophecies**.

- Incorporating **Hebrew** **prayers** and **blessings** into **worship** **services** not only **honors** the **linguistic** **roots** of **Judaism**, but also **deepens** **spiritual** **connection** to **God** through **ancient** **expressions** of **faith**.
