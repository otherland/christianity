<li>It is interesting to note that the New Testament has significantly fewer chapters than the Old Testament, but it contains crucial teachings about the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, as well as <a href="/where-does-the-new-testament-begin-a-comprehensive-guide-for-christian-readers">the early Christian</a> church.</li>
