<p><a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/1/Acts-1-8.html">Acts 1:8</a> records Jesus saying, "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth." This verse in the Book of Acts highlights the commission given by Jesus to His disciples, marking the beginning of the spread of the Gospel message and the start of the New Testament era.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The New Testament also includes letters written by the apostles to various churches and individuals, providing guidance, encouragement, and theological teachings. These letters, such as those written by Paul, Peter, and John, serve as important documents in shaping early Christian beliefs and practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The New Testament canon was not officially established until several centuries after the events it describes. Early Church leaders and councils had to discern which writings were divinely inspired and should be included in the sacred scripture.  process of canonization helped solidify the boundaries of the New Testament.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The New Testament serves as a bridge between <a href="/ultimate-guide-best-order-to-read-the-bible-for-beginners">the Old Testament</a> and the teachings of Jesus Christ. It not only provides historical accounts of Jesus' life and ministry but also offers theological interpretations of his significance for humanity.  New Testament thus forms a crucial part of Christian theology and understanding of salvation.<strong>The New Testament begins with the Book of Matthew, which is the first book in the New Testament section of the Bible.

It serves as an introduction to the teachings and significance of Jesus for Christians.</strong></p>

This verse immediately establishes the lineage of Jesus, connecting Him to the promises made to David and Abraham in the Old Testament.  genealogy highlights Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Book of Matthew is unique among the Gospels for its focus on Jewish customs, traditions, and prophecies, making it particularly significant for Jewish-Christian readers.  emphasis on connecting Jesus to the Old Testament helps bridge the gap between the two parts of the Bible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matthew's Gospel also contains a strong emphasis on Jesus as the King of the Jews, presenting Him as the long-awaited Messiah who fulfills the prophesied role of a Davidic king.  portrayal of Jesus as a royal figure resonates with the Jewish expectation of a powerful ruler who would restore Israel's glory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The genealogy in Matthew 1 not only establishes Jesus' lineage but also includes the names of several women, such as Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba.  inclusion of women in the genealogy challenges traditional patriarchal norms and highlights God's faithfulness to use unexpected individuals in His redemptive plan.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>When did the New Testament begin?</h2>
<p><strong>The New Testament began after the life and ministry of Jesus Christ on earth. Following His resurrection and ascension, the early Christians began documenting His teachings, miracles, and impact on humanity. These writings eventually formed the New Testament, with the Book of Matthew marking the beginning of this new covenant.</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/9/Hebrews-9-15.html">Hebrews 9:15-17</a>, it is mentioned, "Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant." This passage emphasizes the transition from the Old Covenant to the New Covenant through the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ.</p>
<ul>
<li>The New Testament consists of 27 books, including the four Gospels, Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation. These books were written by various authors, such as Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul, and Peter, among others, to share the teachings and message of Jesus Christ.</li>
