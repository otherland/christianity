Despite its brevity, Obadiah delivers a powerful message about God's justice and the consequences of pride.</strong></p>
<p>Obadiah's message serves as a reminder that God sees and judges the actions of nations and individuals. It emphasizes the importance of humility and righteousness, as well as the consequences of turning away from God's ways.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Obadiah/1/Obadiah-1-15.html">Obadiah 1:15</a> - "The day of the Lord is near for all nations.  you have done, it will be done to you; your deeds will return upon your own head."</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Jude/1/Jude-1-3.html">Jude 1:3</a> - "Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt compelled to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to God’s holy people."</strong></p>
