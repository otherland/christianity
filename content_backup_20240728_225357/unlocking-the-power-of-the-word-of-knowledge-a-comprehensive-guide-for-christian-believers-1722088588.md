The **word of knowledge** is a spiritual gift mentioned in the Bible, specifically in [1 Corinthians 12:8](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/12/1-Corinthians-12-8.html). It is a supernatural revelation or insight into a specific situation or information that is not known through natural means. This gift allows individuals to receive divine knowledge about a person, event, or circumstance to bring understanding, guidance, or revelation. It is a manifestation of the Holy Spirit's wisdom and understanding given to believers for the edification of the church.

Scripture Reference: [1 Corinthians 12:8](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/12/1-Corinthians-12-8.html) - "To one there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom, to another a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit,"

- The word of knowledge is often accompanied by the word of wisdom, another spiritual gift mentioned in the same passage in [1 Corinthians 12:8](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/12/1-Corinthians-12-8.html). While the word of knowledge pertains to insight and information, the word of wisdom involves the application of that knowledge in a practical and wise manner.
  
- In practical terms, the word of knowledge can manifest in various ways, such as receiving a sudden understanding of a person's struggles without prior knowledge, accurately predicting a future event through divine insight, or discerning hidden truths that bring clarity and healing to a situation.
  
- The word of knowledge is not limited to clergy or spiritual leaders; it can be given to any believer who is open to receiving and operating in spiritual gifts. By cultivating a sensitivity to the Holy Spirit and a willingness to step out in faith, individuals can experience the supernatural flow of divine knowledge in their lives and ministries.


## Examples of the gift of knowledge

The **gift of knowledge** can manifest in various ways, such as knowing details about someone's past, present, or future that you wouldn't naturally know, understanding complex situations with clarity, or receiving insights into spiritual truths. For example, you might suddenly know someone's name and background without them telling you, or you could discern the root cause of a problem in a person's life through divine revelation.

Scripture Reference: [Colossians 2:2-3](https://www.bibleref.com/Colossians/2/Colossians-2-2.html) - "My goal is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."

- The gift of knowledge can also be seen in the ability to interpret dreams, as seen in the story of Joseph in the Bible who was able to interpret Pharaoh's dream and predict a coming famine.
- Some people with the gift of knowledge may have a knack for remembering and recalling obscure facts or details that prove to be valuable in certain situations.
- The gift of knowledge can also come in the form of discernment, where individuals are able to accurately perceive the motives and intentions of others, helping to navigate relationships and situations with wisdom and insight.


## Signs you have the gift of knowledge

If you possess the **gift of knowledge**, you may experience moments of sudden insight or understanding that surprise you. You might find yourself knowing things about people or situations that you couldn't have known naturally. This gift often operates in conjunction with other spiritual gifts, such as discernment, prophecy, or wisdom. Pay attention to these instances of supernatural knowledge and seek to use them for the benefit of others and the advancement of God's kingdom.

Scripture Reference: [1 Corinthians 2:10-11](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/2/1-Corinthians-2-10.html) - "These are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. For who knows a personâ€™s thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God."

- People with the gift of knowledge may often feel a strong sense of responsibility to share what they have learned with others, as they see it as a way to bring light and understanding to those around them.
  
- This gift can also manifest in the form of an intuition or gut feeling that guides individuals to make decisions that are in alignment with God's will, even if they may not fully understand the reasoning behind it at the time.
  
- It's important for those with the gift of knowledge to remain humble and remember that their insights are ultimately a gift from God, not something they have earned or achieved on their own. This humility will help them use their gift in a way that glorifies God and serves others.
