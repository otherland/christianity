## What makes someone a Christian?

Being a **Christian** means more than just identifying with a religious label; it involves a personal relationship with **Jesus Christ**. To be a Christian, you must believe that **Jesus** is the Son of **God** who came to Earth, died for your sins, and rose again. This belief is the foundation of **Christianity**, and it transforms your life, values, and worldview.

In the **Bible**, the term "Christian" appears only three times, but the essence of what it means to be a Christian is woven throughout the Scriptures. In **[Acts 11:26](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/11/Acts-11-26.html)**, we see that the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch because of their devotion to **Christ**. This devotion is at the core of **Christian identity** and sets believers apart.

- Being a Christian also involves living out the teachings of Jesus and striving to follow his example of love, compassion, and forgiveness. It is not just about believing in Jesus, but also about actively living a life that reflects his teachings.
  
- Christians are called to be a light in the world, sharing the message of God's love and grace with others. This involves not only words, but also actions that demonstrate the love of Christ to those around them.
  
- Being a Christian also means being part of a larger community of believers, known as the Church. This community provides support, encouragement, and accountability as believers grow in their faith and seek to live out the teachings of Jesus in their daily lives.


## What makes a person a Christian?

Becoming a **Christian** involves more than simply acknowledging the existence of **Jesus**; it requires a personal decision to follow Him as **Lord** and Savior. This decision involves repentance of sin, acceptance of **Jesus**' sacrifice, and commitment to living according to **God**'s will. Through faith in **Christ**, you are adopted into God's family and receive the gift of eternal life.

In **[John 1:12](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-12.html)**, we read that "But to all who did receive Him, who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of **God**." This verse highlights the personal choice and belief required to become a **Christian**. By receiving **Jesus** and believing in Him, you are transformed into a child of **God**.

- Baptism is often seen as a public declaration of one's faith in Christ and a symbol of being cleansed of sin and born anew in the Christian faith. It is a tangible way to demonstrate one's commitment to following Jesus.
- Being a Christian also involves living out the teachings of Jesus and striving to embody His love, compassion, and forgiveness in daily life. This includes practicing humility, serving others, and seeking to bring hope and healing to those in need.
- A key aspect of being a Christian is building and nurturing a personal relationship with God through prayer, reading the Bible, and participating in the Christian community. It is through this relationship that one grows in faith and experiences the transformative power of God's love.
