## What is the significance of friendship in the Bible?

**Friendship** holds a prominent place in the **Bible**, reflecting the value and importance of **relationships** in our lives.  **Bible** tells us that **friends** are there to help us in times of need, to provide comfort and encouragement, and to walk alongside us on our spiritual journey. **Jesus** Himself emphasized the value of **friendship** when He said in **[John 15:13](https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-13.html)**, "Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's **friends**."

In **[[Ecclesiastes 4:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/4/Ecclesiastes-4-9.html)-10](https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/4/Ecclesiastes-4-9.html)**, it is written, "Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up.  pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up." This verse emphasizes the strength and support that **friendship** provides. When you understand the significance of **friendship** in the **Bible**, you can see how **God** designed us to thrive in **community and relationship** with others.

- The **Bible** also teaches us about the importance of choosing our **friends** wisely.  **[Proverbs 13:20](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/13/Proverbs-13-20.html)**, it says, "Walk with the wise and become wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm." This verse reminds us that the **friends** we surround ourselves with can influence our thoughts, behaviors, and ultimately our spiritual growth.

- **Friendship** in the **Bible** is not only about receiving support and encouragement, but also about offering it to others. **[Proverbs 17:17](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/17/Proverbs-17-17.html)** states, "A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for a time of adversity." This verse challenges us to be **friends** who are loyal, loving, and present for others, especially during times of struggle.

- **Jesus** modeled true **friendship** in His relationships with His disciples. He showed compassion, forgiveness, and sacrificial love towards them, even when they were unfaithful or made mistakes.  demonstrates to us the kind of **friend** we should strive to be - one who is willing to lay down their life for others and show unconditional love.

Ask **God** to help you be a source of encouragement, support, and love to your new **friend**. Trust in **God's** plan for your relationships and pray for His guidance every step of the way.

This verse illustrates the mutual growth and edification that can occur in **friendships**.
