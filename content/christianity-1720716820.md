## What do the prophecies of Jeremiah and Ezekiel reveal about David's role in the Millennium?
Jeremiah 30 and Ezekiel 37 prophesy Israel's return to their land, freedom from oppression, and the restoration of their relationship with God under a new King. This King is likened to David due to his lineage and characteristics. However, these prophecies ultimately point to Jesus Christ, the awaited Messiah, who fulfills the role of a King like David. Jesus, as the Son of David, embodies the qualities associated with David, serving as a spiritual and righteous leader ([Isaiah 42:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+42%3A1&version=KJV)).

## Why is Jesus often referred to as "David" besides His lineage?
Beyond being from David's lineage, Jesus is likened to David for several reasons. King David was known as a man after God's own heart ([Acts 13:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+13%3A22&version=KJV)), chosen by God, and empowered by the Spirit. In typology, David foreshadows Christ, just as Elijah prefigured John the Baptist. Therefore, when referring to Jesus as "David," it signifies His divine appointment, spiritual leadership, and fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies ([1 Samuel 16:12–13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+16%3A12%E2%80%9313&version=KJV)).

## Will David be resurrected and reign with Jesus in the Millennial Kingdom?
David, along with other Old Testament saints, will be resurrected at the beginning of the Millennium ([Daniel 7:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+7%3A27&version=KJV)). While David will have a significant role in the Kingdom, believers in Christ will also share in ruling the nations and judging the world ([Revelation 2:26–27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+2%3A26%E2%80%9327&version=KJV); [1 Corinthians 6:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+6%3A2&version=KJV)). Christians are described as a chosen race and royal priesthood, indicating a shared authority with Christ in His Kingdom ([1 Peter 2:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+2%3A9&version=KJV)).

## What does Scripture reveal about the authority believers will have in the Kingdom?
According to Scripture, believers will have varying levels of authority in the Kingdom based on their faithfulness and stewardship in this life ([Luke 19:11–27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+19%3A11%E2%80%9327&version=KJV)). Jesus, as the King of kings, will share His throne with those who overcome ([Revelation 3:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+3%3A21&version=KJV)). Christians are promised to reign with Christ, exemplifying the authority and glory bestowed upon them ([Ephesians 2:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A6&version=KJV)).

## Who is the ultimate King during the Millennium and beyond?
While David holds significance in Old Testament prophecies, Jesus Christ is the ultimate King of kings ([Revelation 19:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+19%3A16&version=KJV)). Jesus, from the Davidic dynasty, surpasses David in power, glory, righteousness, and every aspect. Scripture confirms that Jesus is the future King of the Millennium and eternity ([Jeremiah 23:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+23%3A5&version=KJV); [Isaiah 9:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+9%3A7&version=KJV)).

## How does Jesus fulfill the role of the Greater David in the Millennial Kingdom?
In the Old and New Testaments, Jesus embodies the fulfillment of the Greater David, reigning with unmatched authority and righteousness. As prophesied, "The government will be on his shoulders" ([Isaiah 9:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+9%3A6&version=KJV)). Jesus' dominion as the King of kings is solidified in Scripture, establishing Him as the sovereign ruler of the Kingdom ([Revelation 17:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+17%3A14&version=KJV)).

## How can believers prepare for their role in ruling with Christ in the Kingdom?
The anticipation of reigning with Christ in His Kingdom should motivate believers to steward their lives faithfully and serve with diligence. By embracing their identity as a royal priesthood and chosen race, Christians can align their actions with God's purposes, ensuring they will share in Christ's authority in the age to come. The responsibility of believers in this life directly impacts their role in ruling alongside Christ in the Millennial Kingdom and beyond ([Revelation 2:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+2%3A26&version=KJV)).
