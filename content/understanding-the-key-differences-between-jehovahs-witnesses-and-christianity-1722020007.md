## What are the core beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses and how do they differ from Christianity?

Jehovah's Witnesses have distinct beliefs that set them apart from mainstream Christianity. They reject the doctrine of the Trinity, believing that **God** is a single being and that Jesus is a created being. They also do not celebrate holidays like **Christmas** and **Easter**, considering them to have pagan origins.  contrast, Christianity upholds the belief in the Trinity - the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as one God - and celebrates the birth and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

In Christianity, the **Bible** is considered the inspired and authoritative word of God, guiding believers in their faith and practice. Jehovah's Witnesses, on the other hand, use their own translation of the Bible called the **New World Translation** which has been criticized for altering certain passages to fit their beliefs.  difference in interpretation can lead to varying perspectives on key theological doctrines.

* **[John 1:1](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html)**: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
* **[[2 Timothy 3:16](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/3/2-Timothy-3-16.html)-17](https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/3/2-Timothy-3-16.html)**: "All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work."

* Jehovah's Witnesses also do not believe in the concept of hell as a place of eternal punishment. They interpret hell as the common grave of mankind, where the wicked will be annihilated rather than suffering forever.
* Unlike many Christian denominations, Jehovah's Witnesses do not participate in politics or military service, as they believe in remaining politically neutral and following the example set by Jesus in the Bible.
* Jehovah's Witnesses emphasize the importance of evangelizing and spreading their beliefs through door-to-door preaching and distributing literature, viewing it as a fundamental aspect of their faith and obedience to God's commandments.


## How do Jehovah's Witnesses view salvation compared to Christianity?

Jehovah's Witnesses believe in a works-based salvation, where one must actively engage in preaching, attending meetings, and following strict moral guidelines to earn **God's favor**. They do not believe in the concept of **grace** as taught in Christianity, where salvation is a gift from God that cannot be earned through works. Christians believe that salvation is by faith alone in Jesus Christ, who paid the price for sin through His death and resurrection.

The Bible teaches in **[[Ephesians 2:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-8.html)-9](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/2/Ephesians-2-8.html)**: "For by grace you have been saved through faith.  this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast." This verse emphasizes the **importance** of faith in Jesus Christ for salvation, highlighting the distinction between Christianity's belief in grace and Jehovah's Witnesses' emphasis on works.

- Jehovah's Witnesses believe in a limited number of 144,000 individuals who will go to heaven, while the rest of the faithful will live on a paradise earth.  differs from Christianity, which teaches that all believers will go to heaven to be with God for eternity.
 
- Jehovah's Witnesses do not celebrate holidays such as Christmas and Easter, as they view them as having pagan origins.  contrast, Christianity celebrates these holidays as significant events in the life of Jesus Christ and the faith.
 
- Jehovah's Witnesses believe in the imminent end of the world and the establishment of God's Kingdom on earth, where only believers will be saved.  contrasts with Christianity, which believes in the return of Jesus Christ to judge the living and the dead, with salvation offered to all who believe in Him.


## How do Jehovah's Witnesses and Christians differ in their views on the end times and the afterlife?

Jehovah's Witnesses have specific beliefs about the end times, including the belief that only **144,000** chosen individuals will go to heaven to rule with Christ.  rest of faithful Jehovah's Witnesses will live on a paradise Earth after Armageddon.  contrast, Christianity teaches a more universal view of **heaven** and **hell**, where all believers in Jesus Christ will spend eternity with God in heaven, while unbelievers will be separated from God in hell.

The **Book of Revelation** provides insights into the end times, such as in **[[Revelation 21:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/21/Revelation-21-1.html)-4](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/21/Revelation-21-1.html)**: "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away... He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away."

- Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the **Second Coming** of Christ has already occurred invisibly in 1914, marking the beginning of the end times.  belief is based on their interpretation of biblical prophecies and the signs of the times.
 
- Christians believe in the **resurrection of the dead** at the end times, where all individuals will be judged according to their faith and deeds.  belief in the final judgment is a central tenet of Christian theology, emphasizing the importance of living a righteous life in preparation for eternity.
 
- Jehovah's Witnesses reject the concept of an **immortal soul**, teaching that humans are mortal and do not possess an eternal soul.  contrast, Christianity teaches that individuals have an immortal soul that will be judged and sent to either heaven or hell based on their faith and actions during their earthly life.

In Christianity, **[Hebrews 10:25](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/10/Hebrews-10-25.html)** encourages believers to not neglect meeting together, while **[Romans 13:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/13/Romans-13-1.html)** reminds Christians to be subject to the governing authorities. These verses highlight the importance of **fellowship** with other believers and respecting governmental authorities within [the Christian faith](/ultimate-guide-best-order-to-read-the-bible-for-beginners).

The **[Gospel of John](/ultimate-guide-best-order-to-read-the-bible-for-beginners)** emphasizes the **divinity** of Jesus Christ, as seen in **[John 10:30](https://www.bibleref.com/John/10/John-10-30.html)**: "I and the Father are one." This verse underscores the unity between Jesus and God the Father, a key aspect of the Christian belief in the Trinity.

- Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the **savior** of humanity, who died on the cross for the forgiveness of sins, while Jehovah's Witnesses view Jesus as a **perfect man** who served as a ransom sacrifice to restore what was lost in the Garden of Eden.
- The **New Testament** writings, particularly the letters of **Paul**, emphasize the **divinity** of Jesus Christ and his role in the salvation of believers, which is a key aspect of Christian theology that differs from Jehovah's Witnesses' beliefs.
